\description{
  Calculates the integral length scale.
}
\details{
  Uses equation XYZ from Semiu and Scanlan book to compute
  the integral length scale: \deqn{L =
  \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{\bar{U}}{f_\text{peak}}}{L = 1/(2.pi)
  Um / f_peak} The spectrum is computed using
  \code{\link{spec.pgram}} and parameter \code{spans} is
  passed to this function to smooth the spectrum. If
  parameter \code{nn} is \code{NULL}, all points of the
  spectrum is fitted. If it is an integer, the point os
  maximum spectral density is found
  (\eqn{f_\text{peak}}{f_peak}) and the spectrum is fitted
  using only points whose frequency is smaller than
  \eqn{nn\cdot f_\text{peak}}{nn.f_peak}.

  The log of spectral density and log of frequency are than
  fitted to a \code{degree} degrees polynomial and the peak
  frequency is calculated and used to calculate the
  integral length scale.
